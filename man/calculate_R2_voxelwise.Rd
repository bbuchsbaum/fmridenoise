\title{Calculate Voxel-wise R-squared}
\usage{
calculate_R2_voxelwise(Y_observed, Y_residuals)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_observed}{Matrix of observed data (timepoints x voxels).}

\item{Y_residuals}{Matrix of residuals from a model (timepoints x voxels).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of R-squared values, one for each voxel. Names are stripped
from the returned vector.
}
\description{
Calculate Voxel-wise R-squared. For each voxel valid observations are
selected using \code{!is.na(Y_observed[, j])}. The total sum of squares (TSS)
and residual sum of squares (RSS) are computed from these valid values only.
If TSS is zero the returned R\eqn{^2} value is 0.
