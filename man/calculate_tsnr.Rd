\title{Calculate Temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR)}
\usage{
calculate_tsnr(Y_data, detrend = FALSE, robust = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_data}{Numeric matrix of fMRI data or residuals (timepoints x voxels).}

\item{detrend}{Logical, if TRUE, linearly detrend each voxel's time series before
calculating mean and standard deviation. Defaults to `FALSE` as input data
(e.g. residuals from a GLM that included trends) might already be detrended.}

\item{robust}{Logical, if `TRUE`, use median for mean and MAD for standard deviation.
Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length `ncol(Y_data)` containing the tSNR value for
  each voxel. Returns `NA` for voxels with zero standard deviation or if issues occur.
}
\description{
Computes the temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) for each voxel in an fMRI dataset.
tSNR is typically calculated as the mean of a voxel's time series divided by its
standard deviation over time.
