\title{Calculate Beta Stability Across Runs}
\usage{
calculate_beta_stability(betas_per_pass)
}
\arguments{
\item{betas_per_pass}{A list where each element corresponds to a pass and
contains a list of beta matrices (one per run).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of average cross-run correlations for each pass. If a
  pass contains fewer than two runs, the returned value is `NA`.
}
\description{
Computes average pairwise correlations of task beta coefficients across runs
for each pass of the ND-X workflow.
