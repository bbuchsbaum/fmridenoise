  workflow_output,

\arguments{
\item{workflow_output}{List returned by `NDX_Process_Subject`.}

\item{pass0_residuals}{Matrix of residuals from `ndx_initial_glm` used as the
starting point for ND-X. Required for the PSD comparison.}

\item{TR}{Numeric repetition time (seconds) for frequency axis in the PSD plot.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory in which to save the HTML file and PNG figures.}

\item{filename}{Name of the HTML file to create. Default "ndx_diagnostic_report.html".}

\item{include_progressive_enhancement}{Logical, whether to include the four-panel
progressive enhancement visualization (requires Annihilation Mode). Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the generated HTML file.

\description{
This function creates a simple HTML report summarizing key diagnostics from
a run of `NDX_Process_Subject`. It plots the Denoising Efficacy Score (DES)
across passes, compares the power spectral density (PSD) of residuals from
Pass 0 and the final ND-X pass, visualizes \eqn{\beta}-stability across runs,
shows the Ljung--Box p-value progression, and optionally displays a spike
"carpet" plot from the RPCA `S` matrix. Internal helper functions create each diagnostic plot.
