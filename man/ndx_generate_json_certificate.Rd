\title{Generate "ND-X Certified Clean" JSON Sidecar}
\usage{
ndx_generate_json_certificate(workflow_output, output_path = "sub-ndx.json")
}
\arguments{
\item{workflow_output}{List returned by `NDX_Process_Subject`.}

\item{output_path}{File path to save the JSON sidecar. Defaults to
"sub-ndx.json" in the current working directory.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the written JSON file.
}
\description{
This function creates a JSON file summarizing key diagnostic metrics and
adaptive hyperparameters from an ND-X run. The resulting JSON includes
fields for the ND-X version, final Denoising Efficacy Score (DES),
final beta stability, Ljung-Box p-value (from final pass), median Ljung-Box
p-value (from final unwhitened residuals), the Annihilation verdict
ratio and category (if applicable), convergence information (number of passes),
final rho noise projection, and all final adaptive hyperparameters.
Downstream tools can parse this certificate to verify denoising quality.
The workflow hash included in the JSON is computed from the diagnostics and
key settings rather than the full `workflow_output` object to avoid
excessive memory usage.
