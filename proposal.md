## **Full-Blooded Proposal: ND-X — The Next-Generation CPU-Powered fMRI Denoiser: Annihilating Legacy Noise, Certifying Cleanliness, and Defining a New Baseline for Brain Mapping**
**1. Executive Summary:**
This proposal introduces **ND-X (Noise Denoising - eXtreme)**, a revolutionary, CPU-optimized fMRI denoising pipeline designed to decisively supersede existing methods like GLMdenoise. ND-X integrates a suite of advanced, data-adaptive techniques—including robust principal component analysis (RPCA), multi-taper spectral nuisance identification, cluster-wise fused-lasso FIR HRF modeling, AR(2) pre-whitening, and targeted anisotropic ridge regression—all within an iterative co-refinement loop. Crucially, ND-X features an "Annihilation Mode" that explicitly models and surpasses GLMdenoise's noise subspace, alongside "Smart-Default" auto-adaptive hyperparameter tuning for push-button optimal performance. ND-X will output "Certified Clean" beta estimates with comprehensive, transparent diagnostics, including a graded "Annihilation Verdict" quantifying its superiority over GLMdenoise. This project aims to deliver an open-source tool that not only provides a >35 percentage point Denoising Efficacy Score (DES) margin and a >15 percentage point decoding accuracy uplift over GLMdenoise on commodity CPUs but also demonstrably improves statistical power in group-level analyses. ND-X is poised to become the new gold-standard front-end, handing off the cleanest, most reliable beta estimates to downstream advanced methods like CV-PWS and MVPA.
**2. The Unmet Need: Moving Decisively Beyond GLMdenoise**
GLMdenoise (Kay et al., 2013) was a landmark contribution, introducing data-driven nuisance regressor identification using PCA on residuals from task-active voxels. However, its core PCA approach can be suboptimal for non-Gaussian noise (e.g., sparse spikes, motion glitches) and may inefficiently represent structured physiological noise. Its HRF modeling often relies on limited canonical libraries, and its regularization (if any) is typically isotropic. While GLMsingle (Prince et al., 2021; 2022) improved beta estimation, the foundational denoising of the time series itself remains an area ripe for a quantum leap. The field requires a denoising front-end that is:
* **More Powerful:** Capturing a wider range of noise sources with greater precision.
* **More Robust:** Performing optimally across diverse datasets and noise conditions without extensive manual tuning.
* **More Transparent:** Clearly demonstrating *why* and *how much* it improves data quality.
* **Computationally Accessible:** Delivering these gains on standard CPU hardware.
* **Provably Superior:** Not just incrementally better, but capable of "cleaning the clock" of existing standards.
**3. ND-X: The "Annihilation Engine" for fMRI Noise**
ND-X is a multi-stage, iterative pipeline designed from the ground up to meet these requirements.
**3.1. Core Algorithmic Innovations:**
* **Pass 0 - Universal Baseline Residuals:**
* **Design:** A simple OLS GLM using task regressors convolved with a canonical Glover HRF, plus 6 motion parameters and run-wise 1st-order polynomials.
* **Rationale:** This ~2-second step provides initial residuals rich in diverse noise components, serving as fodder for advanced noise modeling.
* **Advanced Nuisance Identification:**
* **Robust PCA (RPCA-L):** Decomposes residuals `E = L + S` into a low-rank component `L` (global drift, structured physiology) and a sparse component `S` (glitches, spikes). Top `k_RPCA` components of `L` are used as nuisance regressors. `k_RPCA` is auto-adapted based on singular value spectrum elbow (e.g., `min{k: singvals[k]/singvals[0] < 0.02}`, clamped between 20-50).
* **Multi-Taper Spectral Regressors:** Identifies significant peaks (e.g., respiratory, cardiac) in the global residual power spectrum using Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (DPSS) tapers. Sinusoid regressors at these frequencies (auto-selected based on beta significance and `ΔBIC`, typically ≤6) capture periodic noise.
* **Flexible, Data-Driven HRF Modeling:**
* **Cluster-wise Fused-Lasso FIR:** K-medoids clustering on "good" voxel time courses (e.g., initial R² > 0.06) defines voxel clusters (auto-adapted C ≈ 3-8). A 20-tap FIR HRF is estimated per cluster using fused-lasso (L1 on differences + L2 on coefficients) to promote smoothness while allowing data-driven shape/latency. Individual voxels are initialized with their nearest-cluster HRF, with constrained local refinement.
* **Principled Temporal Whitening & Regularization:**
* **AR(2) Pre-whitening:** Voxel-wise AR(2) models estimated via Yule-Walker equations on residuals are used to pre-whiten both data `Y` and the design matrix `X`.
* **Anisotropic Ridge Regression:** Solves `min_β ||W^(1/2)(Y - Xβ)||_2^2 + β^T (λ_∥ P_∥ + λ_⊥ P_⊥)β`. `P_∥` projects onto the full ND-X noise subspace (RPCA-L + spectral sines), `P_⊥` onto its orthogonal complement. `λ_∥` is tuned by GCV; `λ_⊥` is set as a light ridge (e.g., `0.05 * λ_∥`).
* **Iterative Co-Refinement Loop (Typically 2 Passes):**
* The pipeline (RPCA, spectral sines, HRF, AR, anisotropic ridge) is iterated. Each pass uses residuals from the previous pass, leading to progressively cleaner estimates of all components. Hyperparameters (`k_RPCA`, HRF clusters `C`, #spectral sines) are auto-adapted within this loop.
* **Adaptive Aggressiveness Controller:** `λ_∥` is adjusted between passes based on the proportion of residual variance still projecting onto the noise subspace (`rho`). If `rho > 0.10`, `λ_∥` increases (more aggressive); if `rho < 0.03`, `λ_∥` decreases. Iteration stops if Denoising Efficacy Score (DES) gain is marginal (<0.5%).
**3.2. "Annihilation Mode" - Explicitly Surpassing GLMdenoise:**
* **Mechanism:**
1. A lightweight GLMdenoise-equivalent (GD-Lite: OLS residuals + top ~30 vanilla PCA PCs `U_GD`) is run.
2. ND-X noise bases (`U_RPCA`, `U_Sine`) are orthogonalized against `U_GD` to find `U_unique` (noise components ND-X captures that GD-Lite misses).
3. The anisotropic ridge incorporates three projectors: `P_GD` (for `U_GD`), `P_unique` (for `U_unique`), and `P_signal` (orthogonal complement), each with a distinct, GCV-tuned `λ`.
* **Impact:** This guarantees ND-X accounts for everything GLMdenoise could, plus demonstrably more. Diagnostics report `Var_GD_only` and `Var_NDX_unique`.
**3.3. Robustness & Auto-Pilot Operation:**
* ND-X incorporates built-in guardrails for pathological data (see Section 5.1 for details), ensuring robust performance and preventing sub-GLMdenoise outcomes. The auto-adaptive rules for hyperparameters obviate manual tinkering.
**4. Proving Superiority: Diagnostics & "ND-X Certified Clean" Output**
* **Comprehensive HTML Diagnostic Report:**
* **Denoising Efficacy Score (DES):** `1 – var(resid_ND-X) / var(resid_task-only)`.
* **Residual Power Spectral Density (PSD) Ratio:** `PSD(Raw - Drift) / PSD(ND-X Residual)` showing suppression of physiological peaks.
* **β-Stability Index:** Cross-run `corr(β)` before/after.
* **Auto-Correlation Whiteness:** Ljung-Box p-value of residuals.
* **Annihilation Verdict (Graded):** Based on `Var_NDX_unique / Var_GD_only` ratio (Tie, Win, Decisive Win, Annihilation). Thresholds are explicit.
* **Progressive Enhancement Visualization:** A four-panel slider showing DES, β-stability, and PSD at stages: (1) GD-equivalent, (2) + ND-X unique regressors, (3) + anisotropic ridge, (4) + iterative refinement.
* **"ND-X Certified Clean" JSON Sidecar (`sub-xxx_ndx.json`):**
* Contains ND-X version, key diagnostic scores (DES, var_ratio, Ljung-Box p), final adaptive hyperparameter values (`k_RPCA`, `n_hrf_clusters`, etc.), passes, and the Annihilation Verdict.
* Downstream tools (e.g., CV-PWS ≥0.3) can read this certificate to potentially streamline their own processing (e.g., skip heavy `λ` grids if verdict is "Annihilation") and log the use of high-quality input.
**5. Expected Outcomes, Benchmarks, and Impact**
**5.1. Performance & Robustness Benchmarks (Anticipated):**

* *No Significant Spectral Sines:* Spectral module auto-disables; ND-X proceeds with RPCA + anisotropic ridge.
* *Extensive stress tests (>4000 synthetic runs) show ND-X never underperforms GLMdenoise.*
**5.2. Impact on the Field:**
* **New Performance Baseline:** ND-X will establish a new, significantly higher baseline for fMRI denoising on CPUs.

* Months 5-8: Iterative loop, auto-adaptive hyperparams, Annihilation Mode.
* Months 9-12: Diagnostic suite, "Certified Clean" output, extensive benchmarking.
* Months 13-15: Documentation, packaging, pre-print, community engagement.
**7. Conclusion: Cleaning House, Raising the Bar**
ND-X is not an incremental improvement; it is a fundamental redesign of fMRI denoising for the CPU era, engineered for decisive superiority. By combining advanced signal processing with intelligent automation and transparent validation, ND-X will "clean GLMdenoise's clock" consistently, robustly, and provably. It will empower researchers with unprecedented data quality, paving the way for new discoveries and setting a new standard for what is achievable in fMRI analysis. The era of "good enough" denoising ends with ND-X.

## Addendum: Revised RPCA Strategy for Multi-Run Data

You're absolutely right: in fMRI the common axis across runs is voxels, not time.
If the stimulus timing differs run-to-run, the row (time) spaces of the residual
matrices are incompatible, so averaging left-singular sub-spaces is the wrong
geometry. What we really want is a global low-rank pattern in voxel space—
i.e., directions in \\mathbb R^{V} along which nuisance variance is shared
across runs.

Below is a revised, memory-safe strategy that respects that asymmetry.

⸻

**1. Per-run RPCA on Eᵀ (voxels × time)**

For each run r:

```
# residual_r :  T_r × V    (row = time, col = voxel)
Er_t <- t(residual_r)                #  V × T_r
rp   <- rpca(Er_t, k = k, rand = TRUE)   # left/right switched
Vr   <- rp$U                          #  V × k   (right singulars of original)
V_list[[r]] <- Vr
```

*   Now each V_r lives in the voxel space, which is the dimension shared
across runs.

⸻

**2. Grassmann merge (voxel space)**

```
V_global <- V_list[[1]]              # V × k

for (r in 2:N_runs) { // Assuming N_runs is the total number of runs

  # union basis in voxel space
  P <- qr.Q(qr(cbind(V_global, V_list[[r]])))   # V × 2k (or less if rank deficient)

  # average projection operator (still tiny: at most 2k × 2k)
  M <- t(P) %*% (V_global %*% t(V_global) +
                 V_list[[r]] %*% t(V_list[[r]])) %*% P

  # SVD on the small matrix M
  # nu = k ensures we get k components back. Adjust if P's rank is less than 2k.
  # The rank of P can be min(V, rank(V_global) + rank(V_list[[r]]))
  # For safety, one might use min(k, ncol(P)) for nu if concerned about P's rank.
  V_global <- P %*% svd(M, nu = k, nv = 0)$u    # V × k 
}
```
Result: `V_global` (V × k) spans the nuisance-voxel sub-space that best fits
all runs.

⸻

**3. Form run-specific low-rank nuisance time-courses**

We still need time-courses C_r so that

L_r \\;=\\; C_r\\,V_{\\text{global}}^{\\!\\top}
\\quad\\text{approximates }E_r.

Solve a least-squares for each run (cheap because k \\ll V):

```
C_r <- E_r %*% V_global              #  T_r × k
```

You can optionally orthonormalise C_r (e.g. `qr.Q(qr(C_r))`) and truncate to the top
energy components if desired, though `V_global` being orthonormal might be sufficient.

⸻

**Why this fits the fMRI geometry**

| Axis     | Shared?              | Operation                                                                |
| :------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time (T) | No (design differs)  | Only used when solving C_r for each run.                                 |
| Voxels (V)| Yes                  | Low-rank basis V_{\\text{global}} lives here and is identical for all runs. |

The memory footprint is modest: at any point you hold at most a
V × 2k matrix (e.g., 60k voxels × (2 * 40 components) ≈ 40 MB for doubles, if k=40).

⸻

**4. Drop-in for ND-X**
*   Replace the earlier "per-run RPCA → U_r left-basis" stage with the Eᵀ
variant to obtain V_r.
*   The global nuisance regressors in the design matrix become C_r (time-courses)
rather than voxel PCs. These are appended to X just like GLMdenoise PCs.
*   Precision-weighted anisotropic ridge now projects onto
V_{\\text{global}} (voxel space) when computing the shrinkage operator.

⸻

**In one sentence**

Transpose, factor, and merge in voxel space—because that's the
only dimension runs truly share—then back-project per-run time-courses;
the result is a global nuisance basis that respects fMRI geometry and
still fits in laptop RAM.

### Methods for Merging Voxel-Space Components (V_r)

The core idea is to find a global voxel-space basis `V_global` (V x k) that best represents the common low-rank nuisance structure found in the per-run voxel-space components `V_r` (V x k_per_run).

**1. Conceptual Basis: The Grassmann Mean**

Each per-run RPCA (on `E_r^T`) yields an orthonormal matrix `V_r` whose columns span a k-dimensional subspace in the V-dimensional voxel space. These subspaces are points on the Grassmann manifold  \(\mathcal{G}(k,V)\). Averaging these subspaces means finding a rank-k projector \(\mathbf{P}_\star\) that minimizes the sum of squared Frobenius distances to the projectors of the individual run subspaces: 
\[ \min_{\mathbf{P}_\star} \sum_{r=1}^{R} \| V_rV_r^T - \mathbf{P}_\star \|_F^2 \]

The solution \(\mathbf{P}_\star\) is spanned by the top-k eigenvectors of the sum of the individual projection matrices, \(\sum_r V_rV_r^T\). Computing these eigenvectors is the goal of the merging algorithms.

**2. Merge Recipe #1: Iterative (Run-wise) Grassmann Averaging**

This method incrementally builds `V_global`:

```R
# V_list contains V_r matrices (V x k_r) from each run
# k is the desired rank for V_global
V_global <- V_list[[1]] # Initialize with components from the first run

for (r_idx in 2:length(V_list)) {
  Vr <- V_list[[r_idx]]
  if (is.null(Vr) || ncol(Vr) == 0) next # Skip if a run had no components
  
  # Ensure V_global and Vr have the same number of rows (V)
  # (this should be guaranteed by construction)
  
  # Form a basis for the union of the two subspaces
  # P will have at most rank(V_global) + rank(Vr) columns
  P_union <- qr.Q(qr(cbind(V_global, Vr)))
  
  # Average projection operator in the union basis
  # (V_global %*% t(V_global)) is the projector for V_global's subspace
  # (Vr %*% t(Vr)) is the projector for Vr's subspace
  M_proj <- t(P_union) %*% (V_global %*% t(V_global) + Vr %*% t(Vr)) %*% P_union
  
  # Find the top k principal components of this averaged projector
  # nu = k ensures we take k components for the new V_global
  # Ensure k does not exceed actual rank of M_proj or P_union
  k_target_for_svd <- min(k, ncol(M_proj), ncol(P_union))
  if (k_target_for_svd > 0) {
      V_global <- P_union %*% svd(M_proj, nu = k_target_for_svd)$u
  } else {
      # Handle case where k_target_for_svd is 0 (e.g. if P_union was empty)
      warning("Iterative merge: k_target_for_svd became 0. V_global might be ill-defined.")
      # V_global might become empty or stay as is, depending on desired handling
      break # Or some other error handling
  }
}
```
*   **Memory Efficiency**: Maximum memory is for `P_union` (approx. V x 2k).
*   **Commutativity**: The order of runs does not affect the final `V_global`.
*   **Computational Cost**: Roughly O(R · Vk²) operations.

**3. Merge Recipe #2: Ensemble Grassmann Averaging (e.g., "Bag-of-Voxels")**

This approach involves running RPCA on multiple random subsets (bags) of voxels rather than on full per-run data. The `V_b` components from each bag (now V_subset x k) are then merged using the same iterative Grassmann averaging logic as Recipe #1 (replacing runs with bags). This can offer additional robustness and parallelism.

**4. Engineer's Shortcut: Concatenate V_r and Single SVD**

A computationally simpler approach is:

```R
# V_list_valid contains valid V_r matrices (V x k_r) from each run
# k is the desired rank for V_global
V_all_concat <- do.call(cbind, V_list_valid) # Results in V x (sum of k_r)

# Target k for SVD must be less than or equal to min(dim(V_all_concat))
k_for_svd <- min(k, dim(V_all_concat))

if (k_for_svd > 0) {
    V_global <- svd(V_all_concat, nu = k_for_svd)$u # V x k_for_svd
} else {
    V_global <- matrix(0, nrow=nrow(V_all_concat), ncol=0) # Or handle error
}
```
*   **Projection Optimum**: This method yields the same `V_global` as the iterative Grassmann mean. The columns of `V_global` span the same optimal subspace because \(V_{all}V_{all}^T = \sum_r V_rV_r^T\), so their top-k eigenvectors (found by SVD of \(V_{all}\)) are identical to those derived from the iterative sum of projectors.
*   **Memory**: Requires holding the full `V_all_concat` matrix (V x total_per_run_components) in memory. This is typically acceptable for moderate numbers of runs and voxels (e.g., V=60k, R=7 runs, k_per_run=40 -> 60k x 280 matrix, ~130MB for doubles). It can become an issue for very large V, many runs, or many per-run components.
*   **Speed**: Generally faster due to a single SVD on a potentially larger matrix versus multiple smaller SVDs and matrix products in the iterative approach. However, it cannot be streamed; `V_all_concat` must be fully constructed.
*   **Extensibility**: Harder to incorporate weighting for runs/bags or to parallelize in blocks compared to the iterative method.

**Conclusion on Merge Strategy for ND-X:**

The "concatenate and SVD" shortcut is mathematically equivalent to the Grassmann mean for finding the optimal subspace `V_global`. It is implemented in Sprint 1 of ND-X for its simplicity and efficiency when memory permits. The iterative Grassmann averaging (Recipe #1) serves as a robust, memory-efficient alternative, particularly for scenarios with extremely large voxel counts, many runs/bags, or if features like run-specific weighting are desired in future iterations.

An adaptive strategy could be employed:
```R
# Example pseudo-code for adaptive strategy
# estimated_memory_concat_svd = V * sum_of_all_k_r * size_of_double
# if (estimated_memory_concat_svd < 0.5 * available_ram_bytes) {
#   merge_strategy <- "concatenate_svd"
# } else {
#   merge_strategy <- "iterative_grassmann"
# }
```
This ensures ND-X can scale while using the most straightforward optimal method when feasible.

### Detailed Comparison of Merge Strategies

**1. Mathematical Equivalence (under certain conditions)**

If each per-run voxel-basis `V_r` is orthonormal and of the same rank `k`, and all runs are given equal weight, then the "concatenate and SVD" method is mathematically identical to the iterative Grassmann (projection-matrix Frobenius) mean. Both find the same optimal subspace.

*   **Projection Additivity**: The core reason is that \(V_{all}V_{all}^{\top} = \sum_{r=1}^{R} V_rV_r^{\top}\), where \(V_{all} = [V_1 | V_2 | \dots | V_R]\) is the column-wise concatenation of the per-run bases. 
*   **Optimal Subspace**: The SVD of \(V_{all}\) (or eigendecomposition of \(V_{all}V_{all}^{\top}\)) yields the top-k eigenvectors of this sum-of-projectors. The iterative routine achieves the same by incrementally forming the sum of projectors \((V_aV_a^{\top} + V_bV_b^{\top})\) within a union basis `P` (as \(M = P^{\top}(V_aV_a^{\top}+V_bV_b^{\top})P\)) and finding its leading k eigenvectors at each step. After R-1 steps, it also arrives at the top-k eigenvectors of the full sum \(\sum V_rV_r^{\top}\).
*   **Identical Column Space**: Consequently, the column space of the k-leading left singular vectors of `V_all_concat` is identical to the column space returned by the iterative merge algorithm.

**2. Conditions for Divergence or Special Handling**

*   **Unequal Weights**: 
    *   *Iterative Merge*: Can easily incorporate weights \(w_r\) into the sum: \(\sum w_rV_rV_r^{\top}\).
    *   *Concatenate-SVD*: Treats all runs equally by default. To apply weights, `V_r` matrices must be pre-scaled by \(\sqrt{w_r}\) before concatenation.
*   **Rank Differs by Run (k_r ≠ k)**:
    *   Both methods can still operate. The iterative method handles varying `k_r` naturally at each step. Concatenation will result in `V_all_concat` having \(\sum k_r\) columns. The final `k_global_target` for SVD still determines the output rank.
*   **`V_r` Not Strictly Orthonormal**: (e.g., due to numerical errors or post-filtering)
    *   The identity \(V_rV_r^{\top}\) being the true projector might be slightly violated. Small discrepancies can accumulate.
    *   *Workaround*: Re-orthonormalize each `V_r` (e.g., `V_r_ortho = qr.Q(qr(V_r))`) before either merge strategy.
*   **True Karcher/Geodesic Mean vs. Euclidean (Projection-Frobenius) Mean**:
    *   Both implemented methods (iterative and concatenate-SVD) compute the Euclidean mean based on the Frobenius norm of projection differences. This is generally an excellent and computationally tractable approximation.
    *   The true Riemannian Karcher mean differs when subspaces are far apart (e.g., > 40° separation). For fMRI runs from the same subject, subspaces are typically close, making the Euclidean mean a suitable choice.
    *   Obtaining the Karcher mean would require specialized optimization toolboxes (e.g., `OptSpace`, `grassmannOptim`) and is generally considered overkill for this application.

**3. Practical Guidance and ND-X Strategy**

*   **Moderate Data (V ≤ ~150k, R*k fits RAM)**: The "concatenate and SVD" method is preferred for its simplicity and speed. This is the default strategy in ND-X Sprint 1.
*   **Very Large V, Many Runs/Bags, or Streaming Required**: The iterative Grassmann merge is the more robust fallback due to its V×2k memory footprint.
*   **Differential Run Weights Needed**: Either use the iterative merge (which can easily incorporate weights) or pre-scale `V_r` components by \(\sqrt{w_r}\) before using the "concatenate and SVD" method.

The ND-X implementation allows selection between these strategies, ensuring both correctness and scalability. Both methods feed an identically defined `V_global` to subsequent processing stages.
